Overview

Labs
####
There are 7 + 1 labs in this course.
You'll learn how to **design** a kernel by **implementing** it yourself.

There are 2 types of exercises in each lab.

================== ===========================================================================================
``basic``          You're required to implement it by the description, they take up major of your scores.
``advanced``       You can implement some of them to get a bonus.
================== ===========================================================================================

.. important::

  You must finish todos in exercises to get scores.

There is no limitation on which programming language you should use for the labs.
However, there are a lot of things that are language-dependent and even compiler-dependent.
You need to manage them yourself.

You can check last year's `course website <https://nycu-caslab.github.io/OSC2024/>`_ to see what you might need
to do during this semester.
Yet, the requirements and descriptions may differ this semester.

Grading Policy
##############

**PLAGIARISM is not allowed**, including copying from previous years.

It's allowed and recommended to discuss with others, but you still need to write it on your own
instead of copy/paste.

TAs validate plagiarism by asking for the detail of your implementation, and by running the plagiarism checker.
If we find you cheating on labs or you can't elaborate your code clearly, you won't get any score.

Your code may work on an emulator even it's wrong.
Hence, you get 90% of the score if your code works on QEMU but not on real rpi3.

For late hand-in, the penalty is **10% per week**.

.. important::
  Remember to commit your work to your own repository in GitHub Classroom.
  During the demo session, we will check the **timestamp of your last commit** to determine your final score.

Discord Server
##############

Make sure to join the course's Discord server to receive important announcements and participate in discussions.

For course-related questions, please ask directly in the Discord serverâ€”**TAs will not respond to private messages**.

You may privately message the TAs on Discord or email us **only** for grade-related or other privacy-sensitive issues.

If you actively and correctly answer other people's questions on the Discord server, you can earn a **bonus** for your grade.
